# Voting Eligibility Program

## Description
This program determines whether a user is eligible to vote based on their age. It prompts the user to input their age and checks if they meet the minimum voting age requirement.

## Features
- Checks if the user is under the minimum voting age (18 years).
- Informs the user if they are eligible or not eligible to vote.
- Validates the user input for a valid age.

## Code Explanation
The program starts by defining the minimum voting age. It then prompts the user to enter their age and evaluates the input against the eligibility criteria:

- If the age is less than 18, the user is informed that they are not eligible to vote.
- If the age is 18 or older, the user is informed that they are eligible to vote.
- If the input is invalid (negative or non-numeric), the program asks for a valid age.
